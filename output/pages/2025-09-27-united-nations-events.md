The American Indian Law Alliance (AILA) is active at key international gatherings in New York, including the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) and the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), where it amplifies Haudenosaunee and broader Indigenous perspectives. AILA helps convene the [Global Indigenous Women’s Caucus (GIWC)](http://aila.ngo/category/united-nations/giwc/) and the [Global Indigenous Peoples Caucus (GIPC)](http://aila.ngo/category/united-nations/gipc/), providing platforms for Indigenous nations and communities to shape collective strategies and recommendations presented to UN bodies. During these sessions, AILA co-organizes side events on topics such as sovereignty, environmental justice, and Indigenous women’s leadership, and it sponsors the [annual Indigenous Peoples Craft Fair](http://aila.ngo/category/united-nations/craft-fair/), which uplifts traditional artists while educating the public and diplomats about Indigenous cultures and economies. These activities ensure that Indigenous peoples, particularly women and youth, have a visible and influential presence in shaping global policy frameworks on rights, development, and climate justice.
