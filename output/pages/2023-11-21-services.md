# Our services

We provide culturally grounded legal services for Indigenous peoples. We partner with Indigenous nations and organizations globally to advance sovereignty, human rights, and social justice through advocacy, research, and capacity-building.

## Supporting Indigenous Sovereignty through education and healing.

Archival Work

The American Indian Law Alliance (AILA) documents and preserves Indigenous peoples’ participation in international forums such as the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) by digitizing records, testimonies, and media through digital platforms safeguarded and accessible for future generations, while honoring community protocols for stewardship and guardianship.

Cultural Renewal & Mutual Aid

The American Indian Law Alliance (AILA) supports cultural renewal and Mutual Aid by strengthening community ties and ensuring that cultural traditions and responsibilities are passed on to future generations. The organization hosts elders’ luncheons that honor and care for community knowledge keepers, while also creating intergenerational spaces of learning. AILA provides direct support through family food boxes, coat and gift giveaways, and back-to-school programs, ensuring families have access to essentials while reaffirming the Haudenosaunee ethic of caring for one another. These initiatives embody a gift economy rooted in reciprocity and balance, weaving together cultural renewal with concrete acts of mutual aid.

Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives

Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit relatives (MMIW/MMIR) names a crisis rooted in colonization and made worse by broken systems. Many cases never enter national databases, are misclassified, or get lost in gaps between tribal, state, and federal jurisdictions. Families face slow or no response, and media coverage often ignores Indigenous victims.

Language Classes

Through Haudenosaunee language classes, AILA fosters the preservation and revitalization of Indigenous languages as central to identity and governance.

## Our work

We are committed to fulfilling its purpose and vision as it strives to defend Mother Earth and leave behind a better world for the next seven generations. In our struggle for sovereignty, human rights, and social justice, we remain committed to upholding the principles and values handed down through the generations by our ancestors. Sovereignty, balance, social justice, and environmental justice are not separate spheres for us. Instead, we understand them to be all interrelated components of the same thing: honoring Mother Earth, following our ancestors’ teachings, and making the world a better place for the seven generations yet to come.
