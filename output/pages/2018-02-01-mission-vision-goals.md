**Our purpose** is to work with Indigenous Nations, communities, and organizations globally in our struggle for sovereignty, human rights, and social justice for our peoples while remaining committed to our original instructions handed down through our ancestors to preserve Indigenous traditions for the seventh generation yet to come.

**Our vision** is to empower Indigenous communities by being the catalyst for the advancement of self-determination, to promote our social, economic, and cultural development. We do this through education, capacity building, and legal advocacy.

**Our ultimate goal** is based on the principle of the seventh generation. By working with Indigenous Nations and communities globally, we seek to further the defense of Mother Earth and leave behind a healthy world for the next seven generations.

## Summary

The American Indian Law Alliance is committed to fulfilling its purpose and vision as it strives to defend Mother Earth and leave behind a better world for the next seven generations. In our struggle for sovereignty, human rights, and social justice, we remain committed to upholding the principles and values handed down through the generations by our ancestors. Sovereignty, balance, social justice, and environmental justice are not separate spheres for us. Instead, we understand them to be all interrelated components of the same thing: honoring Mother Earth, following our ancestors' teachings, and making the world a better place for the seven generations yet to come.
