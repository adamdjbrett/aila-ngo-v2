The American Indian Law Alliance ([AILA](http://aila.ngo)) undertakes programs rooted in Haudenosaunee values and international Indigenous advocacy. At the United Nations, AILA helps lead the [Global Indigenous Women’s Caucus (GIWC)](http://aila.ngo/category/united-nations/giwc/) and the [Global Indigenous Peoples Caucus (GIPC)](http://aila.ngo/category/united-nations/gipc/), organizes side events, and coordinates [the annual Indigenous Peoples Craft Fair](http://aila.ngo/category/united-nations/craft-fair/), ensuring Indigenous voices remain central in global policy. The [Lakeback](https://lakeback.org) campaign aims to restore Maple Bay and heal Onondaga Lake, the birthplace of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, through events such as the [Haudenosaunee Wooden Stick Festival](http://aila.ngo/category/news-events/festival/) and the Sacred Lake 5K Run, as well as sustained advocacy efforts to restore Maple Bay. AILA also supports Cultural Renewal and Mutual Aid by offering language classes, hosting elder luncheons, and distributing family food boxes, coats, and gifts, strengthening ties across generations. The organization’s work on _Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit (MMIWG2S),_ also known as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives, highlights the ongoing crisis of violence rooted in colonial systems, carried out in partnership with the [National Indigenous Law and Justice Institute (NILJ)](http://aila.ngo/nilj-partnership/), which provides policy tools and legal advocacy for safety and justice. Finally, through Public Education initiatives such as Treaty Talks and [Doctrine of Discovery](http://aila.ngo/issues/doctrine-of-discovery/) presentations, AILA fosters understanding of Indigenous sovereignty, history, and rights, equipping communities to confront past injustices and build more just futures.
