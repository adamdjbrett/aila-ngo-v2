You can stand with us in this work. Sign up for our newsletter to stay informed, follow the American Indian Law Alliance on social media ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/americanindianlawalliance), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/americanindianlawalliance/)) to help amplify our voice, and consider making a donation to support our ongoing advocacy. Take time to learn by reading our booklets and [resources](http://aila.ngo/links/), which break down complex issues like treaties, the [Doctrine of Discovery](http://aila.ngo/issues/doctrine-of-discovery/), and the [fight to restore Onondaga Lake](http://aila.ngo/programs/lakeback/). And listen to the podcasts we recommend and help produce—these stories give deeper context, highlight lived experiences, and connect past and present struggles. Every action you take strengthens this movement for justice and renewal.
