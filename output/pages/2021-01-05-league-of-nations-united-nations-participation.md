**League of Nations/[United Nations](/united-nations-photo-gallery/) Participation** 

**Haudenosaunee leadership have participated in international diplomacy dating back to the League of Nations in an effort to seek redress for the many illegal and unfair practices by settler colonial nation states and extractive industries.** Cayuga Chief Deskaheh traveled to Geneva in 1923 to address the League of Nations about the right of his people to live freely on their own lands, practice their own religion, and follow their own laws, the door was shut in his face by what he called “cruel indifference.” Upon his return, Deskaheh was never allowed back across the border to his home in Six Nations, Ontario, Canada. Chief Deskaheh lived the rest of his life in Buffalo, New York separated from his family.
