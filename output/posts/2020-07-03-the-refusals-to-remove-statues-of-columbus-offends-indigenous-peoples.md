> All these symbols of racism that we face on a daily basis keep us oppressed. It's that hand of oppression. So in one way they are always saying here take my hand in friendship and with the other they are still holding us down. You can't say you are against racism or that you don't believe in that kind of thing and want to change it and yet continue to have all these symbols of racism. ~ Betty Lyons
