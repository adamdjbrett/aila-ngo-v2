> "It all started with Columbus. That is why the movement to rename Oct. 12 as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, and urging inclusion of the [Doctrine of Discovery](/issues/doctrine-of-discovery/) in public education curricula, is so important as part of broader work towards [sovereignty](/issues/sovereignty/), self-determination and full justice for native peoples."

[Why indigenous peoples are right to be offended by Columbus Day](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/indigenous-peoples-offended-columbus-day-article-1.3555690). Op-ed in the New York Daily News by American Indian Law Alliance **President Betty Lyons** (Onondaga Nation) and **Ben Geboe** (Yankton Sioux), interim executive director of the American Indian Community House.
