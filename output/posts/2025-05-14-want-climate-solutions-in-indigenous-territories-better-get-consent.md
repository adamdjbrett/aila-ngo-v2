> For the third year running, Indigenous leaders have called for a permanent moratorium on carbon markets, carbon offsets, and geoengineering technologies at the [United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues](https://grist.org/global-indigenous-affairs-desk/your-guide-to-the-2025-un-permanent-forum-on-indigenous-issues/), or UNPFII. They also demanded an end to all carbon market initiatives within the U.N. like the [REDD+](https://unfccc.int/topics/land-use/workstreams/redd/what-is-redd), a $5 billion payment scheme that aims to protect forests through private investment in the carbon market. That call, led by the Indigenous Environmental Network, or IEN, and supported by the [American Indian Law Alliance](http://aila.ngo/), an Indigenous non-profit, is now bolstered by [an IEN report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRP9i8aw-g6cI48k4wbM1T3taVdBsJ55/view) that documents multiple cases where carbon market, carbon offset, and geoengineering projects have violated Indigenous Peoples rights, and Indigenous people have challenged them. As carbon markets expand into Indigenous homelands, advocates hope these fights for Indigenous rights, in Sápmi and beyond, offer a roadmap to stop a growing industry from exploiting Indigenous peoples.
