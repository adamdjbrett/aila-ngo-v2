For Immediate Release

The American Indian Law Alliance takes very seriously the safety of all Indigenous Peoples.

We have seen the ICE raids directed by the Trump Administration happening across the country and have heard of reports that many members and citizens of Indigenous nations have been targeted, profiled and detained.

We are urging all Indigenous Peoples to be aware of your surroundings, let family members and friends know where you are. Most importantly always carry your identification cards and documents from your Nation with you.

We will see an uptick in the profiling of our peoples. We must remain vigilant. Please report any type of profiling, harassment or detainment by sending an email to [aila.united.nations@gmail.com](mailto:aila.united.nations@gmail.com).
