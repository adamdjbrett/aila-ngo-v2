The [Democratizing Knowledge (DK) Collective](https://democratizingknowledge.syr.edu/) presents the Webinar Series, **_Communities of Color, (In)Justice, and Multiple Pandemics_**. This series brings together artists, community activists, scientists, and scholars to address the multiple pandemics facing communities of color today, from police violence to COVID-19, from environmental racism to economic injustice, to incarceration and detention. Our first webinar, _Resisting the Racism of Covid-19_, is archived [here](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=837305047106401&ref=watch_permalink). Please see DK's [public statement](https://democratizingknowledge.syr.edu/) on the pandemic, "We Can't Breathe..." (June 2020).

The second webinar, **_Centering Native American and Indigenous Communities: Decolonizing Pandemic Politics_**, examines the crisis of Covid-19 within a broader history of structural violence and its impact on land, language, environment, and personal and communal wellbeing.

Confirmed speakers include: **Betty Lyons** (Onondaga Nation, American Indian Law Alliance), **Dr. Brian Thompson** (Oneida / Onondaga Nation, Assistant Dean for Diversity, SUNY Upstate Medical), and **Dr. Jessica Kolopenuk** (Cree, Peguis First Nation, University of Alberta, Canada). **Dr. Danika Medak-Saltzman** (Turtle Mountain Chippewa, Syracuse University) will serve as co-facilitator.
