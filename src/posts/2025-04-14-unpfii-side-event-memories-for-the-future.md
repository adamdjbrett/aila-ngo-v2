## Memories For The Future: Indigenous Knowledge and History of the United Nations

Join us for a collaborative organizing meeting following the screening of Free Leonard Peltier. We will be remembering our ancestors and working to preserve knowledge for the seven generations yet to come. Our goal is to create a working group that will help build an archive and hold this knowledge. We wish to set the future generations up for success and flourishing as we work towards building this archive and preserving our Indigenous knowledge.

DAY:  APR, 25

TIME: 6-9PM

LOCATION: UN Church Center 777 United Nations Plaza
