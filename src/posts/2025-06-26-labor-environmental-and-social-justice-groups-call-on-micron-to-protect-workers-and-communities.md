## **Labor, Environmental, and Social Justice Groups Call on Micron** **to Protect Workers and Communities**

_Following Draft Environmental Impact Statement Release, CNY Advocates Push for 120-Day_ _Public Comment Period and Launch “Community Vision” for Micron_ 

 

SYRACUSE, N.Y. (June 26, 2025) - At a press conference today, 16 community groups delivered a petition with over 1,600 signatories to the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency (OCIDA) requesting a longer and more inclusive public input process on Micron Technology’s plan in Central New York (CNY). These groups also announced their concerns in a new [_Community Vision for Strong Environmental, Resident, and Worker Protections_](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/community-vision-for-strong-environmental-resident-worker-protections-micron-environmental-review?source=direct_link&), which they are encouraging community members to endorse. The press conference followed yesterday’s release of the [Micron Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-marks-major-progress-microns-100-billion-investment-new-york-public-release) by the U.S. Department of Commerce and OCIDA. 

 

CNY organizations came together to call on the Department of Commerce and OCIDA to mandate conditions on Micron to minimize health, safety and environmental harms; protect workers; and maximize equitable quality-of-life and socioeconomic benefits to communities impacted by Micron’s development in CNY. 

 

Speakers emphasized the need for everyone impacted to have an opportunity to review and provide input on Micron’s $100 billion plan — the largest industrial development project in New York state history and the largest microchip fabrication facility in U.S. history. Micron is receiving $5.5 billion in New York’s Green CHIPS Act subsidies and [up to $20 billion in total public subsidies](https://www.syracuse.com/business/2024/05/micron-is-getting-billions-more-in-taxpayer-money-than-anyone-is-talking-about.html). 

 

With this historic investment, Micron has promised investments and thousands of good jobs for CNY, but Micron has not made any enforceable commitments to workers or communities. The groups address this gap in the _Community Vision for Strong Environmental, Resident, and Worker Protections_, developed with local community organizations and leaders with expertise in public policy, environmental law, workforce development and safety, environmental and chemical science, energy technology and infrastructure, and housing and transportation equity.

 

The DEIS document released yesterday aims to assess Micron’s impacts across numerous areas including environmental health, public health and safety, socioeconomic needs, and air and water quality. However, officials have stated that [they only intend to give the federal minimum of 45 days](https://www.syracuse.com/micron/2025/06/release-of-micron-impact-report-delayed-further-crunching-construction-timeline.html) for public comment. Press conference speakers encouraged people to submit comments to the lead agencies right away to request a 120-day public comment period on the Micron DEIS. They also asked supporters to look soon for more guidance on making more substantive comments from local leaders who are closely reviewing the DEIS. 

 

Featured speakers at the press conference included: 

- Catherine Landis, Science Advisor, Center for Native Peoples and the Environment, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry 
- Don Hughes, chemistry professor at Le Moyne College and member of Sierra Club Central and Northern New York 
- Madeline Nyblade, assistant professor of Earth and Environmental Science, SUNY-College of Environmental Science and Forestry 
- Mbonimpa Banabas, IUE-CWA Union Local 320
- Tim Judson, Board Chair and Co-Founder, Alliance for a Green Economy

**Community members raised their concerns:** 

“Given the massive scope of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement, with almost 20,000 pages of appendices, 45 days is grossly inadequate for community members to participate in the public review process. Enough time must be provided for the public to not only review and understand these impacts, but to submit comments that public officials will use to inform project permitting decisions. To fast-track this environmental review process is to risk massive pollution from forever chemicals like PFAS and other harms that cannot be undone. We do not want another toxic pollution disaster that even comes close to or exceeds the damage done to Onondaga Lake by industrial manufacturers.” - Hilary-Anne Coppola, Community Organizer, SustainCNY 

 

"GreeningUSA encourages everyone in Central New York to voice their concerns to the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency about any of the many issues contained in the Micron Draft Environmental Impact Statement, including water quality, energy, pollution, natural resource impacts, housing, transportation and environmental justice. These are the issues that affect our short-term quality of life and ultimately the long-term ability of Central New York to thrive." - John Prezpiora, President and Director, GreeningUSA 

 

“It's called an “industrial park”, but in fact, it is 1000 plus acres of wetlands, forest, and grassland comparable to natural areas on protected State lands. Any wetland mitigation plan must take this larger context into account. These are high quality wetlands that harbor endangered species such as bats. Dozens of other kinds of native plants and animals live here, from monarch and viceroy butterflies, to amphibians, reptiles, and over 100 different kinds of birds. Northern Harrier (Threatened, NYS) and Short Eared Owl (Endangered, NYS) have been sighted here. This is the biggest single industrial development in New York State history, and at least a quarter of its funding is public money. Therefore, the agencies need to hold Micron to the highest possible standards, for example requiring a much higher wetland replacement ratio—somewhere between 5-10 to 1.” - Catherine Landis, Science Advisor, Center for Native Peoples and the Environment, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry 

 

“Micron's semiconductor plant to be built in Clay represents a major opportunity to boost the region's economy, and to create a world-class facility that does not endanger workers, or burden the community with toxic air and water pollution — and it should be run with clean, renewable power. We call on Micron and the sponsoring agencies that are showering the project with billions in subsidies, to create a project that advances cutting-edge technologies to eliminate toxic chemicals, safeguard the health of workers and the environment, and avoid reliance on expensive, toxic nuclear energy." - Don Hughes, Sierra Club Central and Northern New York 

 

“Jobs to Move America is working alongside Central New York partners like Urban Jobs Task Force to ensure the jobs created by the Micron project meet the standard of ‘good job’ this community deserves — especially those who have been historically left out of these types of economic opportunities. Central New Yorkers deserve high-paying, family-sustaining jobs where workers have a voice in the job. They deserve equitable investments in workforce development and a commitment to hire locally and create high-quality training opportunities, especially for historically disadvantaged people. And they deserve solid protections for the community and the environment.” - Khadeejah Ahmad, Syracuse Organizing Manager, Jobs to Move America

"Micron's projected energy usage — equal to the state of Vermont and New Hampshire combined — is unprecedented in the history of Onondaga County. Given the dangers presented by runaway climate change, it is imperative that Micron live up to its commitment of 100% renewable energy for electricity and use as little fossil fuel as possible. The technologies of wind and solar farms, hydro, electric heat pumps for heating and cooling are all currently in operation. It is a question of political will by county, state and Micron officials. We hope that, along with good paying jobs, Micron will commit to providing a safe environment for future generations.” - Peter Wirth, Vice President, Climate Change Awareness & Action 

 

“The Micron development will be massive, about twice the size of the Syracuse University main campus. The soon-to-be developed land is currently wetlands, forests and fields. These cover types allow water to seep into the ground, as well as return to the air through plants. With Micron, this area will be developed into industrial facilities, parking lots, buildings, offices and warehouses. While restoration is planned elsewhere to make up for the wetlands lost on the Micron site, these restored wetlands will not mitigate flooding directly downstream of Micron. To help reduce the impact of Micron on our water: Micron could limit runoff and increase recharge areas and natural habitats on their site; release little to no PFAS into the downstream water; and increase the acres of wetlands protected and restored.” - Maddy Nyblade, Assistant Professor, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry 

 

"Micron will have major impacts on the costs and reliability of electricity in CNY. It will be the largest energy consumer in New York State and will require CNY to import electricity for the first time in nearly a century. Micron's draft EIS states that it will force New York to miss our climate emissions goals because it is not planning to develop enough renewable energy. This is unacceptable. New York State law requires Micron to use 100% renewable energy, in exchange for billions of dollars in subsidies. If Micron does not do that, energy costs and air pollution in CNY could skyrocket as a direct result. On the other hand, Micron could spur the renewable energy industry in CNY, creating thousands more jobs and spreading economic development to communities throughout the region. If Micron wants to be a good neighbor, then it needs to obey the law, avoid polluting our air and water, and take responsibility for its energy needs." - Tim Judson, Board Chair and Co-Founder, Alliance for a Green Economy
