In 2025, for the first time, the award will be presented to two recipients — Oren Lyons Jr. and Roy Simmons Jr. — two longtime friends and teammates whose lives and legacies stand as profound representations of what the game of lacrosse is about. Both Lyons and Simmons have walked alongside Alfie Jacques for decades, as advocates and storytellers. They have lived lives that reflect the deep spiritual and communal roots of the game. A Faithkeeper of the Turtle Clan of the Onondaga Nation and a lifelong defender of Indigenous rights and the natural world, Oren Lyons has been a guiding force in preserving the sacred origins of lacrosse. The legendary former head coach of Syracuse University men’s lacrosse, Roy Simmons Jr. is widely credited for elevating the sport while also maintaining a connection to its Indigenous heritage.
