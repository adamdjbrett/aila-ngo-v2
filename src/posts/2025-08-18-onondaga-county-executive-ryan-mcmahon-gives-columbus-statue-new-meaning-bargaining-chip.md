[McMahon gives Columbus statue new meaning: bartering chip](https://centralcurrent.org/onondaga-county-executive-ryan-mcmahon-gives-columbus-statue-new-meaning-bartering-chip/)

> The Onondaga Nation’s landback effort for a foothold on Onondaga Lake dates back to 2007, when Withers, a local businessman, began organizing a grassroots effort to give the Onondaga Nation a physical presence on their sacred lake.
> 
> Withers spent years meeting with local and state elected officials, university professors, government agencies, advocacy groups, religious leaders, and any residents who were interested in returning lake land to the Onondagas.
> 
> Though not a representative of the Onondaga Nation, Withers felt compelled to play a part in bridging a better relationship between the residents of Onondaga County and the descendants of the original residents of the region.
