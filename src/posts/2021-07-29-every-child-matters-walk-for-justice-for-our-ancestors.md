Please Join us.

Within the last couple of months over 2500 unmarked graves of Indigenous children have been located on the grounds of the Institutions of Genocide aka "Residential schools " throughout Canada and the United States.

We will walk in honor of them and the thousands of survivors who endured unspeakable inhumane treatment by hand of priests, nuns and anyone else who were mandated by the United States Government to "kill the Indian and Save the man ". The dark untold history of these two countries aren't Isolated from the rest of the world. Every single Indigenous/ Aboriginal person can share the painful truth of what the Catholic church has done to their children for generations. We will gather at the parking lot at Tsha' hoñnoñ yeñh dahkwa' at and walk to Columbus Circle. Please wear orange and bring shoes or an item to place on the statue and the steps of the Catholic cathedral. **The walk will begin at 10:00 am**.

We will begin our rally at 1:30 pm with speakers and singers.

Wear comfortable footwear, bring water bottles. Donations needed and greatly appreciated Donations of water and snacks can be dropped off at the Onondaga Nation Administrative Building on Route 11/South Salina St., Nedrow.
