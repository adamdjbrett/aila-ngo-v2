> Shortly before noon, Tadodaho (spiritual leader) Sid Hill and other representatives of the Onondaga Nation unfurled a 25-foot blue banner. Iridescent balloon weights were tied to the bottom to hold it down. In large white letters, it read: 
> 
> > _Return Maple Bay_
> > 
> > _Indigenous Lands in Indigenous Hands_
> > 
> > _#LakeBack_
> 
> The canary yellow _Seneca Chief_ emerged around the corner a few minutes later, flanked by a tugboat, several kayaks, and an entourage of followers. 
>
