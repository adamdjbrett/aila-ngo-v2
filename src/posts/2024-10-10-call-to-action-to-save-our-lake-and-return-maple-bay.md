This year we were honored to award the inaugural AILA Ally award to our friend Robert Abbott for his tireless work these last three years volunteering to walk and clean the lake by picking up refuse dumped around the lake and working to beautify the shoreline. May we all learn from his model and join him in picking up trash when we walk the lake. This October, please take a moment to write a postcard to the Onondaga County Executive, J. Ryan McMahon, II asking him to uphold the county’s promise to return Maple Bay to Onondaga Nation. Here’s some sample language (make sure to change it based on whether you’re an ally or Indigenous!) and the address: [Write The County Executive](https://actionnetwork.org/letters/ask-the-onondaga-county-executive-to-keep-his-promise-to-return-maple-bay?source=direct_link&)
