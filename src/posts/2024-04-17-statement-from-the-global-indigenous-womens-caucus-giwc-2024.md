Madame Chair, Esteemed Members of the Forum, distinguished representatives of Indigenous Nations, member-states, Indigenous Relatives of the world, on behalf of the Global Indigenous Women’s Caucus (GIWC) we are committed to ensuring that our collective voices are heard and uplifted. Collectively, we are in agreement that the issues affecting Indigenous Women, and all Indigenous Peoples have systematically worsened since the adoption of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. As Indigenous Women, we have a sacred relationship to our lands, territories and waterways. The proposed solutions by Member States and UN Agencies to address climate change are nothing more than false solutions that further threaten the lives and livelihoods of all Indigenous Peoples. Member States and UN Agencies in partnership with Indigenous Peoples must do more to address the ongoing issues, in all of the six mandated areas of the Permanent Forum in order to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable development.
