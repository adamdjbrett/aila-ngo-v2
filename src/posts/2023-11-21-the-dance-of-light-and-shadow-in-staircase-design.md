Staircases are not just a means of connecting different levels of a building. They also express the personality of the architect and the client. Modern staircases can be a statement of elegance and sophistication, a focal point of a space. Let's explore how modern staircase design can use light and shadow to enhance the aesthetic appeal of a space.

One of the most impressive examples of modern staircase design is the one in the Art Gallery of Ontario, designed by Frank Gehry. The staircase is made of wood and curves gracefully, creating a sense of fluidity and movement. The design is simple yet striking, with the wood panels creating a sense of warmth and natural beauty. The staircase is also a perfect example of how light and shadow can be used to create a sense of depth and dimension.

The staircase is lit from above, creating a beautiful interplay of light and shadow. The light filters through the wood panels, creating a sense of warmth and intimacy. The shadows create a sense of depth and dimension, making the staircase feel like a living sculpture. The light and shadow also create a contrast between the organic shape of the staircase and the geometric shape of the surrounding walls, creating a dynamic and harmonious balance.

This is just an example of how modern staircase design can use light and shadow to create stunning effects and enhance the aesthetic appeal of a space. There are many more examples of modern staircase design that use light and shadow in creative and innovative ways, such as the one in the National Museum of Scotland, or the one in the Apple Store in New York.
