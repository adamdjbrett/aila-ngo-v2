We invite runners and walkers to come to Onondaga Lake for a day of celebration. This event will raise awareness of the importance of the lake and the urgency of furthering the cleanup efforts.

### **Background to the event**

The Haudenosaunee (Called "Iroquois" by colonists) are the originators and keepers of the game known today as "lacrosse." Deyhontsigwa'ehs ("They Bump Hips," in the Onondaga Language) goes back millennia and is also known as "The Creator's Game" and the "Medicine Game" The Onondaga Nation is the "Central Fire" of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy of six nations (Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora). The Haudenosaunee Confederacy originated on the shore of Onondaga Lake––now called Syracuse, NY. Over 1000 years ago, Deyhontsigwa'ehs had an integral role in establishing "The Great Law of Peace." Today, throughout Haudenosaunee territories, the "Medicine Game" is still played in ceremony. We are dedicated and committed to re-establishing a Haudenosaunee presence here at Onondaga Lake where Deyhontsigwa’ehs was originally played.

### **Our Collaborative Spirit.**

The Haudenosaunee Wooden Stick Festival is a collaboration between the [American Indian Law Alliance](http://aila.ngo) and the [Indigenous Values Initiative](https://indigenousvalues.org/). We have always been proud to collaborate on such an important event. One of the many lessons that we can all learn from Deyhontsigwa'ehs (lacrosse) is the importance of collaboration and working together. This year, the American Indian Law Alliance is taking the lead on the Wooden Stick Festival and letting our dear friends at the Indigenous Values Initiative get some well-deserved rest.

#### **About Randy Hall**

Thomas Randall “Randy” Hall, Akwesasne Mohawk Wolf Clan, passed away on January 18, 2018. He served in Vietnam with the US Army (1965-68) and participated in the 1972 AIM take-over of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C. He loved sports and was deeply involved with the Onondaga Athletic Club, where he played and coached lacrosse and basketball. One of Randy’s favorite things to do was to travel and play in tournaments. In his memory, the Haudenosaunee Wooden Stick Festival honors Randy by naming the Wooden Stick tournament after him. The inaugural Haudenosaunee Wooden Stick Festival was held at Onondaga Lake in 2013. Previously, the game was only played exclusively on Haudenosaunee Nation territories. So in 2013, Randy Hall asked Philip P. Arnold and Sandy Bigtree for help to bring the game back to Onondaga Lake––its place of origin. The Peacemaker arrived at Onondaga Lake well over 1,000 years ago to bring peace to five warring nations. Few realize that Deyhontsigwa’ehs, the Creator’s Game, was an integral part of this peacemaking process. This ancient game is still played ceremonially among the Haudenosaunee. It is played hard, but always played to foster good relationships between human beings and the natural world.
