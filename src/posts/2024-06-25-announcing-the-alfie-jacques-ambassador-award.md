Alf Jacques was known as a stick maker, but he was also a lacrosse ambassador. He took time to teach the values of the Medicine Game and let the world know that lacrosse is a game of community, friendship and peace. Please consider a small donation towards the creation of the next major lacrosse award. The Alf Jacques Ambassador Award will be given to a member of the International lacrosse community who has spent a lifetime not simply growing the game, but growing the game in a way that fosters friendship and peace. This is a brand new award, please spread the word. New website and donation link below.
